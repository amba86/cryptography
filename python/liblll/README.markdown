# LibLLL

LibLLL 0.1 seems to work with python from 2.7 (some bugs in the 
fractions module in previous version) to python 3.2.
LibLLL is not the faster LLL algorithm but it seems to work, 
if you want to improve it -- don't hesitate :)

## Quick start

    export PYTHONPATH=/dir1/dir2/.../liblll:$PYTHONPATH
    python reduction_examples.py

## Documentation

of problems and LibLLL usage.
